CucumberSounds
===============

This plugin adds sound notifications to your Cucumber steps.

Prerequisites

Alsa, Screen, mplayer.
(but this may change if we switch to an all-ruby approach

Usage
=====

Run cucumer -f pretty features/. The sound accompaniment is only set to the Pretty Print format.
When cucumber encounters a passing(green) step, it will play a random file from sounds/pass/.
When cucumber encounters a failing(red) step, it will play a random file from sounds/fail/.

Customization
=============

You can customize the pass and fail sounds by filling vendor/plugins/cucumber_sounds/sounds/*/ with funny audio files of your choice.
